<h1>Lecture 8: Continuous and Discrete Choice</h1>
~~~

This week we will look at the situation when we have both continuous and discrete choices in dynamic models. We will use several resources:

1. We will focus our discussion on [Iskhakov, J√∏rgensen, Rust, Schjerning, QE 2017 *The Endogenous Grid Method for Discrete-Continuous Dynamic Choice Models with (or without) Taste Shocks*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/QE643).
2. We discussed standard methods VFI and Euler Equation solver and simple EGM in [lecture 7](../lecture7), so make sure to go back there and check out those notebooks again.
3. We will use [Fedor Iskhakov](https://fedor.iskh.me/)'s [slides](../assets/tex/dcegm_DSE2019.pdf) from the 2019 DSE summer school. I am using those with Fedor's permission - they are much better than would I could ever come up with, so standing on the shoulder of giants! üôèüèª Thanks Fedor!
4. We will have a look at [my julia implementation](https://github.com/floswald/DCEGM.jl) of their matlab code.
