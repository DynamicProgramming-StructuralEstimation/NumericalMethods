<h1>Getting Started with Julia</h1>
~~~

In this lecture we will start talking `julia`! We will go through a series of notebooks in tutorial style. You can find the notebooks [here](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/tree/master/lecture_notebooks/week2)

## Notebook Formats

You will notice that there are two different notebook formats in our course: the new Pluto.jl format, and the more traditional jupyter notebook. Here's a quick video of how to launch a jupyter notebook server on your computer to run those notebooks - on the example of our course content.
