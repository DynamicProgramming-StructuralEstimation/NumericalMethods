We will look at the DataFrames.jl package this time. This is a [very powerful package](https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/) to work with tabular data, similar to *pandas* or an `R data.frame` or `R data.table`. 


* We'll give a very quick intro to working with data in julia by going through the [first steps with DataFrames.jl](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/man/basics/) tutorial on the manual.
* However, this will be too short to cover all important concepts. I will refer you to several additional sources:
    * The package [manual is very well done](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/) and should be on your list of references.
    * This tutorial series is _very_ good for the DataFrames.jl package: [https://github.com/bkamins/Julia-DataFrames-Tutorial](https://github.com/bkamins/Julia-DataFrames-Tutorial)
    * The [julia academy data science tutorial](https://github.com/JuliaAcademy/DataScience) is full of excellent stuff
    * The [Turing Institute's Data Sciences tutorials](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/) give a good intro to data structures and machine learning in julia.
* After this, we will illustrate use of the `FixedEffectsModels.jl` package and how it compares to R competitors in [this notebook](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/tree/master/notebooks/week8/data_stats.jl)
