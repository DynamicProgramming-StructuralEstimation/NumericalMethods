# Homework 3 - Maximum Likelihood Estimation

This time you will build a fully-fledged maximum likelihood estimator for the probit model.

## Notebooks

Get the notebook here as usual. [right click and save this notebook, or copy the link directly into a running Pluto session to open!](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/blob/master/homework/homework3/Probit.jl)

[Here](https://raw.githack.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/master/homework/homework3/Probit.jl.html) is a static version to view.

**Notice: Project.toml file**

I recommend that you download the entire [folder](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/blob/master/homework/homework3) and then proceed as follows:

1. open julia in the location where you downloaded the folder
2. `] activate .`
3. `] instantiate`
4. `using Pluto; Pluto.run()`
5. start the `Probit.jl` notebook.


## Homework Submission


1. When: You have 7 days.
